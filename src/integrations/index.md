# Tooling and integrations

This is the list of official and third-party tools that support `fluent-vue`.

## Official

### 1. unplugin-fluent-vue

[unplugin-fluent-vue](/integrations/unplugin.html) is a plugin for Vite, Webpack and Rollup. It adds support for defining translation messages in Vue SFCs and external ftl files.

### 2. Webpack loader

**Deprecated. Use `unplugin-fluent-vue` instead.**

[fluent-vue-loader](/integrations/webpack.html) is the officially provided Webpack loader.

With `fluent-vue-loader`, you can use `fluent` custom blocks to define locale messages directly in Vue SFC files.

### 3. Rollup and Vite plugin

**Deprecated. Use `unplugin-fluent-vue` instead.**

Both [Rollup](/integrations/rollup.html) and [Vite](/integrations/vite.html) integrations are provided by `rollup-plugin-fluent-vue` plugin.

It provides the same functionality as Webpack loader - use custom blocks in SFC files.
