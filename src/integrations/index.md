# Tooling and integrations

This is the list of official and third-party tools that support `fluent-vue`.

## Official 

### 1. Webpack loader

[fluent-vue-loader](/integrations/webpack) is the officially provided Webpack loader.

With `fluent-vue-loader`, you can use `fluent` custom blocks to define locale messages directly in Vue SFC files.

### 2. Rollup and Vite plugin

Both [Rollup](/integrations/rollup) and [Vite](/integrations/vite) integrations are provided by `rollup-plugin-fluent-vue` plugin.

It provides the same functionality as Webpack loader - use custom blocks in SFC files.

### 3. WIP: CLI tool

`fluent-vue-cli` is the official tool that (soonâ„¢) allows extracting and importing SFC locale messages to and from FTL files. This allows integration with external translation tools like Mozilla's [Pontoon](https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon/)  

## Third-party

### 1. i18n Ally
